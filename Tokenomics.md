## Tokenomics
The tokenomics of this project has been whiteboarded roughly to assess how yacht sharing would work, meeting the demands of owners, renters and contributers. Where "yachts", "yachting" and more are used please replace with whatever other asset you can think of that could be shared.  

### Overview
Our yacht sharing platform utilizes a dual-token system to facilitate fractional ownership, rental, and governance. The tokenomics are designed to ensure a balanced ecosystem that incentivizes participation, aligns interests, and promotes the platform's growth.

### NFT - Fractional Ownership
LSP8 NFTs represent fractional ownership of yachts on our platform. Each yacht is tokenized into a fixed number of NFTs, with each NFT representing a specific fraction of the yacht's ownership. NFT holders are entitled to a portion of the yacht's usage time and rental income, proportional to their ownership stake. The LSP8 standard is used to create these unique ownership NFTs, ensuring they are easily identifiable and distinguishable.

Specific for yachting, the boat will have to be out of the water every year. This means that out of 365 days, or 52 weeks only 48 weeks can be used. This coincides nicely with 4 NFT owners, each having 12 weeks of time.
